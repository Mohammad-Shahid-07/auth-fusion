# layout.tsx

The `AuthLayout` component is a server-side rendered React component that checks if a user is authenticated and redirects them to the home page if they are. If the user is not authenticated, it renders its children components within a centered layout.

## Imports

```jsx
import { currentUser } from "@/lib/utils/currentSession";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
```

## Component Definition

```jsx
export default async function AuthLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  const user = await currentUser();

  if (user) {
    redirect("/");
  }

  return (
    <main className="flex h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center ">
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

- The `AuthLayout` component is an asynchronous function component that takes a `children` prop of type `React.ReactNode`.
- Inside the component, the `currentUser` function is called to retrieve the current user's session information.
- If a user is found (i.e., `user` is truthy), the `redirect` function is called to redirect the user to the home page (`/`).
- If the user is not authenticated, the component renders its children components within a `<main>` element with some styling classes applied (`flex h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center`).
