# CardWrapper.tsx

This component serves as a wrapper for displaying content within a card layout. It utilizes various sub-components, such as `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`, `CardHeader`, `BackButton`, `Social`, and `Header`. The `CardWrapper` component is designed to be reusable and customizable, allowing you to pass in different props to control the content and behavior of the card.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter, CardHeader } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { BackButton } from "@/components/auth/BackButton";
import { Social } from "@/components/auth/Social";
import { Header } from "@/components/auth/Header";
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
interface CardWrapperProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  headerLabel?: string;
  BackButtonLabel?: string;
  BackButtonHref: string;
  showSocial?: boolean;
}

export const CardWrapper = ({
  children,
  headerLabel,
  BackButtonLabel,
  BackButtonHref,
  showSocial,
}: CardWrapperProps) => {
  return (
    <Card className="w-[400px] shadow-md">
      <CardHeader>
        <Header label={headerLabel} />
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>{children}</CardContent>
      {showSocial && (
        <CardFooter>
          <Social />
        </CardFooter>
      )}
      <CardFooter>
        <BackButton href={BackButtonHref} label={BackButtonLabel} />
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

This component can be used in various scenarios where you need to display content within a card layout. For example, in a dashboard application, you could use this component to display different types of information or statistics within cards. Additionally, in a content management system, you could use this component to display previews or summaries of articles or blog posts within cards.
